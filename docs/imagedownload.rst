Image download system
*********************

| This is a "snippet" of a sort for created to ease the work in the future.
| 
| It can be accessed by adding "feedback/img" to the URL so that it looks somewhat like this:
| **localhost:8000/feedback/img**
| 
| It uses "modelformset_factory" library and works extremley simple
| you upload image, submit it, reload the page and you can upload one more.
| to be more useful it is needs AJAX to erace "upload and reload" part but 
| even now it works non the less.
